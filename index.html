    <h1>Midus Trade GmbH Review – Is midustrade.com a Scam?</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Midus Trade GmbH, operating via <a href="https://midustrade.com" target="_blank">midustrade.com</a>, claims to be a digital asset broker with over 30 years of experience. However, a closer look at the broker reveals major inconsistencies and potential red flags.</p>
    
    <h2>Website Registration and False Claims</h2>
    <p>The domain <strong>midustrade.com</strong> was registered on February 23, 2025, making it a very new broker. Despite this, the website falsely claims to have been in operation for 30 years and to have launched the "Midus Trading Platform" in 2009 – a blatant lie since the domain only appeared recently.</p>
    
    <h2>Company Details – Fake Office Locations</h2>
    <p>Midus Trade GmbH provides addresses in Poland and the UK, suggesting they have offices there. However, when investigating the company, we found that <strong>Midus Trade GmbH is registered in Switzerland as a healthcare facility provider</strong>, with no connection to financial services or trading.</p>
    
    <h2>Trading Conditions and Account Types</h2>
    <p>Midus Trade GmbH offers several account types with a <strong>high minimum deposit of $2,500</strong>. The differences between these accounts lie in fees and available instruments. Upgrading to a higher-tier account requires a deposit of at least <strong>$10,000</strong>, a risky proposition for traders.</p>
    
    <h2>Licensing and Regulatory Status</h2>
    <p>Midus Trade GmbH is <strong>not licensed</strong> by any financial regulatory authority. This lack of regulation means there is no investor protection, making it a highly risky platform for traders.</p>
    
    <h2>No User Reviews or Reputation</h2>
    <p>There are no user reviews of midustrade.com available on the internet. This is highly unusual for a broker that claims to have been in operation for decades. The lack of feedback suggests the broker is either brand new or deliberately suppressing negative reviews.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion – Is Midus Trade GmbH a Scam?</h2>
    <p>Based on our findings, Midus Trade GmbH (midustrade.com) exhibits multiple red flags, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>False claims about its history and platform launch date.</li>
        <li>Providing fake office locations.</li>
        <li>Being unlicensed and unregulated.</li>
        <li>Requiring high deposits with no verified track record.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is highly likely that midustrade.com is a scam. We advise traders to <strong>avoid this broker</strong> and seek regulated alternatives.</p>
